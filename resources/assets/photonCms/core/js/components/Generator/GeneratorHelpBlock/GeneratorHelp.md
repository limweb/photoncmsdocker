# Photon CMS Admin Panel - Generator

## Module Creation - `create`

### About the Generator

The generator is used to set up the main system functionality. You can CRUD modules and their fields through the generator. Keep in mind that some actions may impact your current storage data, so be sure to **back up if you are removing some fields/modules**.

Photon Generator uses a built-in transaction controller. Handling of all requests is performed through transactions and in an event of a failure, the transaction is rolled back. In transactions which impact data in tables (for example removing a field), data will still be affected so **be sure to back up your data before using the generator**!

### Module Types

| Single Entry        | Can have only one entry. If the entry hasnâ€™t been created yet, it will be automatically created. The entry cannot be deleted. Suitable for custom configuration options. |
| Non Sortable        | Regular module with no sorting options.                                                                                                                                  |
| Sortable            | Entries can be sorted and nested within module entries.                                                                                                                  |
| Multilevel Sortable | Entries can be sorted and nested within module entries and entries of another module. Suitable for products and such which should be nested within categories.           |

### Anchor Text

Anchor texts are used to visually represent each entry. For example, for a user, it can be the user first and last name. Module anchor_text field can contain any text and also supports shortcodes for fields.

For example, if anchor text is `User: {{first_name}} {{last_name}}` that means that each entry within that module will have its anchor text compiled by inserting values from `first_name` and `last_name` columns of the respective entry. Like `User: John Doe`.

Many-to-one relations can also be used inside `anchor_text` field. In this case, the shortcode would be the name of the related table name of the field. For example, if your relation is a field named â€˜titleâ€™ in a table named â€˜companiesâ€™, then your shortcode would be `{{companies.title}}`. An example of a whole anchor text of a user would be `{{first_name}} {{last_name}}, {{companies.title}}` and would render to something like `John Doe, Photon CMS Inc.`.

Anchor texts are used by our native frontend for searching within entires of individual dynamic module. They can also be used within API filter route as any other module field.

### Anchor Html

In case you need to implemenet advanced visual representation you can use anchor html. Within it you can store any html code together with shortcodes representing module fields, used in a same way as for anchor text.

If anchor html is defined it will be used for visual representation within our native frontend app. But anchor text will still be used by default for searching.

You can also define your custom method that would be used instead of shortcode representation of fields. In order to use it you need to define your own trait and use it within `/app/PhotonCms/Core/Entities/DynamicModule/DynamicModuleHelpers.php`. Custom method shortcode should be written in this format: `{{argument1,argument2,...,argumentN|methodName}}` where arguments are name of the fields. For example method shortcode `{{width,height|max}}` will call method max from your custom trait, pass fields width and height from individual dynamic module entry, determine which field is larger and print its value within anchor html.
